\section{Test on simulated data}\label{results}
In this section, we test our Coordinate Descent, which uses the direct Fourier Transform, on simulated MeerKAT data. As mentioned in section \ref{cd}, it is unknown if our approach will converge to the true optimum. Nevertheless, we compare our results with CASA's CLEAN implementation, and demonstrate super-resolution performance of Coordinate descent together with accurate total flux modelling.

The two simulated datasets contains idealized MeerKAT observations. Compared to the real world, the two simulated datasets contain few Visibilities and not representative of the real data volume. Also, more realistic simulations which contain pointing-, calibration-, and thermal noise are out of scope for this project. The simulations are used to isolate the two fundamental issues in radio interferometer image reconstruction: Non-uniform sampling and incomplete measurements.

\subsection{Super-resolution of two point sources}
The first simulated observation contains two non-zero pixels, i.e. point sources, with intensity of 2.5 and 1.4 Jansky/Beam. The image has a size of $256^2$ at a resolution of 0.5 arc-seconds per pixel. The integral, the total Flux of the image, is 3.9 Jansky/beam.

The figure \ref{results:points} shows the CLEAN and the Coordinate Descent reconstruction. CLEAN reconstructs the image \ref{results:points:tclean} at the accuracy limit of the instrument. It essentially reconstructs a blurred version of the observed image, where the blurring represents the accuracy of the instrument. With compressed sensing, we aim to reconstruct the de-blurred image, increasing the effective accuracy of the instrument. 

Coordinate Descent in image \ref{results:points:cd} shows a super-resolved reconstruction of the two point sources. It reconstructs two narrow peaks surrounded,by a low-intensity Gaussian emission. Also, Coordinate Descent manages to capture the total flux more accurately than CLEAN.  The total flux of image \ref{results:points:cd} results in 3.92 Jansky/beam. CLEAN on the other hand overshoots the correct total flux by a factor of 1400. The total flux. It gets obvious when we compare the intensity profile of CLEAN, Coordinate Descent and the ground truth in figure \ref{results:points:contour}.

\end{figure}

CLEAN essentially places a Gaussian function with correct peak intensity at the point source location, but it does not respect the total flux of the image. However, note that Coordinate Descent in figure \ref{results:points:contour} seems to have both point sources shifted by approximately a pixel. It looks suspiciously like an off-by one error. Sadly in the time frame of this project, no error was found or an explanation for this behaviour.

\subsection{Super resolution of mixed sources}
This dataset contains a mixture of three Gaussian emissions and sixteen point sources of varying intensities. At the center of the image, it has three point sources underlying a weak extended emission. The image center and one Gaussian emissions are analysed in detail. Coordinate Descent was run for two full iterations, using  $\lambda=0.01$ and $J=7$ starlet layers. The CLEAN and Coordinate Descent reconstructions are shown in figure \ref{results:mixed}. Our algorithm was able to locate the point sources below the accuracy limit of MeerKAT. However, some point sources were reconstructed with artefacts. We analyse two regions of the image in more detail.

Let us look at the intensity profile of first region in figure \ref{results:mixed:cut0:contour}. The Ground truth in image \ref{results:mixed:cut0:img} shows a Gaussian extended emission with an oval shape. The figure \ref{results:mixed:cut0:profile} compares the intensity profile of Coordinate Descent with CLEAN and the ground truth. The intensity profile on the logarithmic scale emphasises the artefacts of the starlet reconstructions. Coordinate Descent used three starlets at different scales to approximate the extended emission. It reconstructed the flux more accurately, but did not capture the shape of the extended emission. Instead, it approximated the oval shape with a uniform Gaussian-like emission. CLEAN on the other hand, did not again over-estimated the flux, but captured the oval shape more accurately.

\end{figure}

The second region in figure \ref{results:mixed:cut1:contour} is more complex. It contains an extended Gaussian emission with several point sources. The intensity profile is cut through the center and two point sources shown in the ground truth image \ref{results:mixed:cut1:img}. CLEAN again accurately reconstructs the peak intensity of the point sources, but over-estimates the total flux of the region. Coordinate Descent separates the point source from the extended emission. Sadly, the first point source seems again shifted by a pixel, while the second point source was reconstructed with three peaks at varying intensities.

Compared to CLEAN, Coordinate Descent with the modified starlet regularization reconstructed the image with a more accurate total flux, and located the point sources below the accuracy of the instrument. The quality of the point source reconstruction varies within the image \ref{results:mixed:cd}. The figure \ref{results:mixed:points} shows four different point sources of in detail. From left to right, the reconstruction quality of each example decreases.

The left image shows shows a reconstruction where the flux is concentrated into a single pixel, and has low intensity emission around. Our modified starlet reconstruction should produce point sources similar to it. The second image from the left looks similar at first glance, but contains a lower intensity "trail". The third and fourth image even contain a fake point source in close proximity.

Our modified starlet has likely a role in these artefacts. In section \ref{cd:starlets:modification}, we described how our modified starlet does not have negative sections. Intuitively, the original starlet penalizes two point sources in close proximity, and forces the emission to be represented with a wider starlet. Since we removed the negative sections, our algorithm can use as many point sources next to each other without any penalty. This would explain the "trail" of single pixel emissions in the second, third and fourth images.

The original starlet wavelet forces the second, third and fourth image of figure \ref{results:mixed:points} to be similar to the first, but at the cost of sparsity. Our modified starlet can represent the image \ref{results:mixed:cd} with 244 non-zero bases, while the original starlet leads to over 2000. It has to correct for the negative image regions it produces.

Our modified starlet leads to a more sparse solution, but may introduce artefacts in reconstructing point sources. In our proof-of-concept-implementation, we used the same $\lambda$ regularization for each layer. Girard et al.\cite{girard2015sparse} used a different $\lambda$ for every layer. It may help reduce the artefacts of our modified starlet, while keeping the sparse representation it provides.
