\section*{Abstract}
The MeerKAT new Radio Interferometer poses an image reconstruction problem on a large scale. Measurements over terabytes in size should be reconstructed to an image. Compressed Sensing reconstructions have the potential to improve the effective accuracy of MeerKAT, but so far were more expensive than the state of the art CLEAN implementation.

We investigate three competing architectures.

WE tried to improve the runtime performance by changing the architecture of the Compressed Sensing reconstructions. We created a new algorithm using the direct Fourier transform, which scales with the number of sparse basis. Sadly, this alone does not improve runtime performance. But maybe its a step to the future of distributed reconstruction algorithms.

Discuss the future of compressed sensing, and is in general still an open problem.
