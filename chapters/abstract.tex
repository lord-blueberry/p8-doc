\section*{Abstract}
MeerKAT new Radio Interferometer, poses a large scale image reconstruction problem.

Compressed sensing reconstructions for Radio astronomy exist, but are slower than CLEAN. 

Compressed Sensing and CLEAN use the same architecture, both use Major Cycle. In this work, we explore if Compressed Sensing reconstructions can be made faster with in a different architecture

Several possibiliites are discussed and a new proof-of-concept algorithm is developed, which does not require a Major Cycle. We estimate the minimum runtime complexity of the algorithm and compare it to CLEAN. 

However, the algorithm is not suitable in the context of meerkat reconstructions. It requires too much memory and 

we come to the conclusion that in the context of MeerKAT reconstructions, the Major Cycle architecture is easier to compute.

No obvious contender to replace the Major Cycle.
