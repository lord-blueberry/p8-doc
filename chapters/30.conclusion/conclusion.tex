\section{Compressed Sensing Reconstructions in the MeerKAT era}
Compressed Sensing and CLEAN based algorithms both use the non-uniform FFT to cycle between Visibility and image space. In this environment, Compressed Sensing needs more cycles to converge than CLEAN. This leads to iterative Compressed Sensing algorithms, which becomes difficult to distribute for the large scale MeerKAT problems. We postulated that one may reduce the runtime cost of Compressed Sensing reconstructions by replacing the non-uniform FFT approximation. Three alternatives were discussed: Optimal Projection on a uniform Grid, using Spherical Wave Harmonics and the direct Fourier Transform.

The optimal projection on a uniform grid is way of reducing the problem to a more manageable size. The grid size is usually a fraction of the original non-uniform measurements for MeerKAT reconstructions. The first step is to search for the optimal projection of Visibilities on a uniform grid. We then reconstruct the image with uniformly sampled Visibilities and do not need the original measurements. However, self-calibration requires a transformation from uniform sampled grid back to the original measurements. Unless one finds a way to project the calibration problem on a uniform grid too, self-calibration destroys the main advantage of this approach.

The second alternative is using Spherical Wave Harmonics instead of the Fourier Transform. It is a new way to represent the Radio Interferometric Measurement Equation and has only recently gained attention again. We analysed published research in this area\cite{carozzi2015imaging, mcewen2008simulating} and see potential for a new reconstruction architecture, which may reduce the overall runtime costs. At this point, it is unclear if or how many imaging problems have to be re-investigated by moving to Spherical Wave Harmonics. The Fourier Transform, self-calibration and the current formalism for Radio Interferometric Measurement equation is based on the plane wave\cite{smirnov2011revisiting}. Spherical Wave Harmonics are not. A real-world reconstruction algorithm with Spherical Wave Harmonics may have to deal with imaging problems in a fundamentally different way.

The last alternative, the direct Fourier Transform, uses the explicit matrix instead of an approximation algorithm. Previous attempts\cite{hardy2013direct} lead to an impractically large matrix for MeerKAT reconstructions, but showed potential for distributed computing. In this project, we improved the runtime costs and memory requirement of the direct Fourier Transform. We used Coordinate Descent together with the starlet transform and created an algorithm which only calculates the direct Fourier Transform for non-zero basis functions. Sadly, our improvements alone were not enough to scale the direct Fourier Transform to MeerKATs data volume. Compared to the non-uniform FFT based algorithms, our approach leads to higher runtime costs for the same measurements. 

In this project we have not found a clear alternative to the non-uniform FFT. It is readily available and currently seems to be the most efficient approximation of the Fourier Transform. The $w$-stacking algorithm\cite{offringa2014wsclean} has introduced some level of distribution for the non-uniform FFT operation, and state-of-the-art Compressed Sensing algorithms\cite{dabbech2018cygnus, pratley2018fast} are developed with distributed computing in mind. Still, the non-uniform FFT tends to dominate the runtime for large scale reconstructions. How to effectively distribute a reconstruction algorithm based on the non-uniform FFT is still an open problem.

With an expansion of the MeerKAT instrument already planned, the reconstruction problem  will only increase in size in the near future. This may force reconstruction algorithms to increasingly rely on approximations instead of exact operations. Indeed, the path to a scalable, distributable reconstruction algorithm may lie in specialized approximations for MeerKAT. The large number of Visibilities are bound to contain redundant information. By increasing the data volume, one likely increases the amount of redundant information. A given Fourier approximation and reconstruction algorithm may waste resources on measurements, which contribute little to the final image. Accounting for redundant information may be a way to increase the accuracy of approximations and reduce the problem size of future MeerKAT reconstructions. With the theory of Compressed Sensing, we can design Fourier approximations and reconstruction algorithms that leverage the redundant information.

To our knowledge, the effect of redundant information is largely unexplored in the Radio Astronomy community. It is unknown how redundancy affects the runtime costs of reconstructions, or how much redundant information is measured by Radio Interferometers. A first Ã®nsight into how much redundancy there is, can be acquired by looking at the $w$-stacking algorithm. After the non-uniform FFT of each stack, they contain largely similar image structures. A MeerKAT reconstructions has between tens to a few hundreds of $w$-stacks. Current CLEAN and Compressed Sensing algorithms do not exploit the redundancy in the $w$-stacks. They add each stack together to the dirty image and continue the process.

For algorithms based on the non-uniform FFT, our current estimation is that redundant information neither benefits, nor hinders the runtime costs. State-of-the-art CLEAN and Compressed Sensing based algorithms use $w$-stacking to transform all Visibilities regardless of information content. Since $w$-stacking scales linearly with the number of Visibilities, removing redundant information likely does not benefit its runtime costs. The direct Fourier Transform on the other hand may be further improved by removing the redundant information. Alternatives to the non-uniform FFT may become viable when we account for redundancy.

Current research in the Radio Astronomy community is focussed on distributing the reconstruction problem. A different approach may be to reduce the problem size first before distribution. A single measurement of the MeerKAT Interferometer may only contribute little to the final image. Our project showed that not all pixels are relevant for the reconstruction. Single $w$-stacks show that there is some level of redundancy in the measurements. With the theory of Compressed Sensing, we can design algorithms that reduce MeerKATs reconstruction problem to a more manageable size. Whether this leads to lower runtime costs for reconstruction algorithms remains to be investigated.
