\section{Compressed Sensing reconstructions in the MeerKAT era}
Runtime is a major drawback of Compressed Sensing reconstructions.

This project searched if the architecture can be optimized for Compressed sensing.

 How to get the runtime down at least to comparable levels of CLEAN is still an open question.
Still an open question
